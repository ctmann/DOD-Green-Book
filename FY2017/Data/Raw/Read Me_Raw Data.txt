This folder used to contain with unzipped source DOD files. New script (as of 10-16-2016) now imports Comptroller data directly from DOD website. 

Advantages:
-Ensures data integrity, greater transparency

Disadvantages:
-Depends on source website to retain records
-Requires network connectivity (some workplaces may prevent R from downloading, due to security protocols)
-Troublesome formatting issues must be corrected using R (and not Excel) instead of being changed locally
